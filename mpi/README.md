Simple benchmark of the MPI_Allreduce function.

I get a problem with 7 or more processes with version `MPICH 3.1.4`, see results
in `carla/` and `otis/`. (carla and otis are my machine names).

With my real code, on `otis`, I have the same problem with `Open MPI 1.8.4`,
`MPIC 1.4.1` and `MPICH 3.1.4`.
